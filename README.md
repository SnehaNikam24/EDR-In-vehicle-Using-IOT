# 🚗💥 EDR – Event Data Recorder in Vehicle using IoT


## 📌 Project Summary

This project focused on the development and integration of an Event-Driven Recording (EDR) system for vehicles, leveraging data from Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and onboard sensors. The system continuously captures critical data during key events such as collisions, sudden accelerations, or system malfunctions. The recorded data is used for post-incident analysis, aiding in accident reconstruction and root cause identification. EDR enhances vehicle safety by providing actionable insights for improving design and developing more advanced safety features.
